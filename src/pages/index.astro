    <Text title="Vitamin K" bg="slate-light">
        Vitamin K is a nutrient that is very important to prevent bleeding.
        Infants do not receive enough vitamin K during development in the womb
        nor with feeds after birth. Unfortunately, some babies with vitamin K
        deficiency will have serious bleeding of the brain which can be
        life-threatening. While a rare occurrence, this does happen and is often
        undetectable before the damage is done. A one-time vitamin K injection
        shortly after birth is sufficient to greatly reduce the chance of this
        serious bleeding in the newborn period. While liquid vitamin K is
        available, it is not readily absorbable from the infant's immature
        gastrointestinal tract and so is not an option for infants. For
        additional information on Vitamin K from the American Academy of
        Pediatrics, please see: <Link
