    <TextBlock title="Vitamin K" bg="slate-dark">
        Vitamin K is a nutrient that is very important to prevent bleeding.
        Infants do not receive enough vitamin K during development in the womb
        nor with feeds after birth. Unfortunately, some babies with vitamin K
        deficiency will have serious bleeding of the brain which can be
        life-threatening. While a rare occurrence, this does happen and is often
        undetectable before the damage is done. A one-time vitamin K injection
        shortly after birth is sufficient to greatly reduce the chance of this
        serious bleeding in the newborn period. While liquid vitamin K is
        available, it is not readily absorbable from the infant's immature
        gastrointestinal tract and so is not an option for infants. For
        additional information on Vitamin K from the American Academy of
        Pediatrics, please see:

    <TextBlock title="Hepatitis B" bg="white">
        Hepatitis B is an infection caused by a virus that can lead to failure
        of the liver as well as cancer. While mothers are usually tested for
        evidence of hepatitis B infection during pregnancy, some infants
        contract this virus even when their mother did not show evidence of
        infection. Due to the devastating nature of hepatitis B illness in
        children as well as the safety and efficacy of the vaccination, it is
        important to start the hepatitis B vaccine series shortly after birth.

        Pediatrics, please see:

    <TextBlock title="Erythromycin Eye Ointment" bg="slate-light">
        There are bacteria that can be present during the birth process which
        can infect the eyes of infants and cause vision damage and blindness.
        The erythromycin eye ointment is a mild yet effective, one-time
        treatment that can be vision saving. For more information on the
        erythromycin eye ointment from the American Academy of Pediatrics,

    <TextBlock title="Decisions for Your Baby" bg="slate-dark">
        <Paragraph>
            Of late, there has been an unfortunate decline in infants receiving
            these newborn medications. Much of this has resulted from
            misunderstanding. Some parents have declined to provide these
            medications because of concerns about safety. Truly, these newborn
            medications are extremely safe. In fact, most parents would be quite
            comfortable providing a chewable vitamin for a child or
            administering antibiotic eyedrops for a toddler with pinkeye. The
            newborn medications are quite similar yet administered in way that
            is effective for the newborn.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            Another misunderstanding springs out of a parental desire to provide
            a more 'natural' experience for their newborn that is felt would be
            more likely to promote optimal health. This back-to-basics push is
            understandable given our society's heightened dependency on
            technology. Certainly, providing infants with breast milk and
            toddlers with a minimal-media environment, ample outdoor play and a
            diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruits is undoubtedly both natural
            and healthy. Yet, declining the newborn medications is something
            quite different. The avoidance of serious infection and life
            threating bleeding is a worthy endeavor which promotes infant
            wellbeing and serves as a foundation for a natural and healthy
            experience in life.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            As a parent you are the decision-maker for your infant. Your baby
            depends on you for everything, which is an awesome honor as well as
            a huge responsibility. If you have any questions or are feeling
            hesitant about the newborn medications, we hope that you will take
            the time to talk with your baby's medical team. We all want to give
            you the most accurate information so that you can make the best
            possible decisions for your baby.
